  <h3>{{ $t('notamMapperTitle') }}</h3>

  <h3>{{ $t('fuelComputerTitle') }}</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      The <strong>Fuel Computer</strong> helps track fuel consumption, added fuel, and estimated
      remaining fuel/time during flight. It supports in-flight decisions and pre-flight planning.
    </p>

    <h5>üîß Input Fields</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Immatriculation</strong>: Aircraft ID or tail number.</li>
      <li><strong>Fuel Unit</strong>: Choose your preferred unit (e.g., Liters, Gallons).</li>
      <li><strong>Fuel Consumption</strong>: Average hourly fuel usage (e.g., 25 L/h).</li>
      <li><strong>Fuel Capacity</strong>: Total tank capacity.</li>
      <li><strong>Consumable Fuel</strong>: Total usable fuel in-flight.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>üìã Displayed Results</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Total Flight Time</strong>: Duration of all logged flights.</li>
      <li><strong>Total Fuel Consumed</strong>: Based on flight time and fuel consumption.</li>
      <li><strong>Total Fuel Added</strong>: Sum of refueling entries.</li>
      <li><strong>Estimated Remaining Fuel</strong>: Added fuel minus consumed fuel.</li>
      <li><strong>Estimated Usable Fuel</strong>: Remaining fuel minus non-usable portion.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Estimated Remaining Time</strong>: Estimated duration left with remaining usable
        fuel.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      ‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Warnings:</strong> Yellow when less than 1 hour of usable fuel remains. <br />
      üî¥ <strong>Alerts:</strong> Red when less than 30 minutes remain.
    </p>

    <h5>üïí Flight Time Table</h5>
    <p>Log each flight block time, as indicated in the logbook.</p>

    <h5>‚õΩ Fuel Table</h5>
    <p>
      Record refueling events. Accurate totals support better fuel estimates. It is possible to
      enter a negative value if a fuel drain was performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible to select different unit of measurement for each entry, in order to match the
      indication found in foreign countries. Internally, all computations are done in Liters.
    </p>

    <h5>üñ®Ô∏è Printing Options</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose to include or hide input tables when printing.</li>
      <li>In portrait mode (on a smartphone): tables are tabbed.</li>
      <li>In landscape mode (on a computer): tables are side-by-side.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>üíæ Session Memory</h5>
    <p>
      The tool saves your session in local storage. When you return, your previous data is
      automatically restored.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>{{ $t('timestampTitle') }}</h3>
  <p>
    This component allows the user to convert between: a Unix timestamp, a UTC date, and a date in a
    chosen timezone. The values thus represent the same moment, in different formats.
  </p>

  <h4>Features</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Support for UNIX timestamps in various units: nanoseconds, microseconds, milliseconds,
      seconds.
    </li>
    <li>Automatic detection of the most plausible unit.</li>
    <li>Timezone selection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Timestamp Field</h4>
  <p>The <strong>Unix timestamp</strong> field is editable:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The button on the left allows you to reset it to the current time.</li>
    <li>
      The dropdown menu allows you to force or detect the <strong>precision</strong> of the
      timestamp:
      <ul>
        <li>Automatic (based on the size of the timestamp)</li>
        <li>Seconds (<code>s</code>)</li>
        <li>Milliseconds (<code>ms</code>)</li>
        <li>Microseconds (<code>¬µs</code>)</li>
        <li>Nanoseconds (<code>ns</code>)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>UTC Date and Timezone</h4>
  <p>
    These fields display the Unix timestamp in <strong>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</strong> and
    in the <strong>selected timezone</strong>. It is possible to edit the date and time in order to
    update the Unix timestamp.
